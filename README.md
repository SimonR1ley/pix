<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->

## Concept Process

We were tasked with building a competition app, and I wanted to build something different. So I came up with the concept of holding for an image. I then started building the wireframes and playing around with the design.

### Ideation

### Wireframes

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

I started with the design of the app, trying to get the screens as close to the mockups as I could. I then started with the navigation. I then got into the functionality of the app, database, and logic of the app.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

- Signup and Login
- Profile Settings Page, where users can change and update their profiles
- Profile page, where users can see their winnings.
- Competitions screen, to view images that could be won.
- Press screen, the means of winning the image.

#### Highlights

<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->

- I really enjoyed working on this app, I liked playing around with the idea and seeing it work.

#### Challenges

<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->

- The main bug I had was that I could not see images posted by other devices. This was a simple fix, I just needed to adjust the rules in Firebase.

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- I would like to add reporting functionality, so users can report duplicates of an image.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
